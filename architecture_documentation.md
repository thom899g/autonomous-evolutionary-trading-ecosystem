# Autonomous Evolutionary Trading Ecosystem - Technical Architecture

## Core Design Principles
1. **Evolutionary Architecture**: System adapts its own neural structures based on performance metrics
2. **Fault Tolerance**: Graceful degradation with circuit breaker patterns
3. **Observability**: Comprehensive logging, metrics, and tracing
4. **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling via distributed processing
